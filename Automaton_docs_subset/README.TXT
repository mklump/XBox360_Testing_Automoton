These 5 design overview documents and the mockScreens_jpg folder subset represent a high level view of the end functional result and initial User Interface designs for this XBox 360 assistance testing framework.
Again much, much thanks to Kevin, Colen, Rose, Experis, and Lyndon for leading us in this valiant push forward.
These design documents are only a smaller subset of the larger overall design for purposes of information hiding.
